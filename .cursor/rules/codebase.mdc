# Codebase Awareness Rule

- When responding to prompts, always consider the entire codebase, not just the currently open file.
- For refactoring, searching, or generating code, ensure all relevant files and folders are included in the analysis.
- If a prompt references `@codebase`, treat it as an instruction to scan and reason about the whole project.
- Respect `.gitignore` and project-specific ignore files unless otherwise specified.
